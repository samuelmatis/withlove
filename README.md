# Withlove.sk - Mapping the Slovak Startup Community

Withlove.sk is a map of Slovak start-up ecosystem - start-up companies, investors, community hubs and co-working spaces. Our content is based on crowd-sourcing. Companies and individuals come to WithLove to create and update their profile. In addition, we developed processes to insure the data is up to date and accurate.

Withlove.sk was started by the [Phirational](https://github.com/Phirational) team on a hackathon in December 2013. Here is a list of all contributors so far:

- Peter Kocian (@peterkocian)
- Lukáš Kubovič (@kubovic33)
